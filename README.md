## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Method 1: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Create a new file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

env:
  BUILD_PATH: "."

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}
        
      - name: Build with Astro
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}/dist

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

2. In your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

3. Push your code to the main branch. The workflow will automatically deploy your site.

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Install gh-pages:
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

3. Add deploy script to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

4. Deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

1. Create a `CNAME` file in the `public/` directory with your domain:
```
owlandpillar.com
```

2. In your domain registrar's DNS settings, add:
   - A record: `@` â†’ `185.199.108.153`
   - A record: `@` â†’ `185.199.109.153`
   - A record: `@` â†’ `185.199.110.153`
   - A record: `@` â†’ `185.199.111.153`
   - CNAME record: `www` â†’ `yourusername.github.io`

3. In GitHub repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Custom domain", enter `owlandpillar.com`
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS"

4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
